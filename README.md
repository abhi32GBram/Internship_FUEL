# CORE Java Training Programs & Concepts

This repository contains a collection of Java projects I've developed, each demonstrating various concepts related to Core Java. Each project is contained within its own directory, allowing for easy navigation and understanding of the codebase.

## Folder Structure

- Each project is organized into its own folder, named after the concept it demonstrates. For example, if there's a project demonstrating inheritance in Java, it would be located in a folder named `Inheritance`.

- Within each project folder, you'll find one or more `.java` files. These files contain the source code for the project. If a project requires multiple classes, those classes are contained within separate `.java` files within the same project folder.

- For instance, if a project demonstrating polymorphism requires two classes (`Animal.java` and `Dog.java`), both of these files would be located in the same project folder (`Polymorphism`).

## Redundancy

While some projects may seem similar at first glance, they are not redundant. Each project is designed to demonstrate a specific concept in isolation, ensuring that the focus remains on the particular feature being demonstrated.
