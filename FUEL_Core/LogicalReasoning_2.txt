ðŸ’¡  A  building has a lobby and it has a bulb and fan and dummy appliance  and we're on the G floor we cant go to the lobby upstairs

The ground floor has fan, tube light, dummy appliance  switches  

How can we guess using only 1 shot which switch is for the tube if the switches are on the ground floor and we cant go upstairs
