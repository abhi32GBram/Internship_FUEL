We have 2 jars of capacity - 5ltr and 3 ltr jars and a tap is running . 
If we want to fill the 5ltr jar with exact 4ltr of water how will we do so .

We don't have any measurement to exactly fill the jar to the required amount - then how will we do so

Solution :

1. Fill the 3-liter jar completely.
2. Pour water from the 3-liter jar into the 5-liter jar until the 3-liter jar is empty. This will leave you with 2 liters of water in the 5-liter jar.
3. Fill the 3-liter jar again.
4. Pour water from the 3-liter jar into the 5-liter jar until the 3-liter jar is empty. This will leave you with 1 liter of water in the 5-liter jar.
5. Fill the 3-liter jar again.
6. Pour water from the 3-liter jar into the 5-liter jar until the 3-liter jar is empty. This will leave you with 2 liters of water in the 5-liter jar.
7. Fill the 3-liter jar again.
8. Pour water from the 3-liter jar into the 5-liter jar until the 3-liter jar is empty. This will leave you with 3 liters of water in the 5-liter jar.
9. Fill the 3-liter jar again.
10. Pour water from the 3-liter jar into the 5-liter jar until the 3-liter jar is empty. This will leave you with 4 liters of water in the 5-liter jar.
